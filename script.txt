BERNARDO

    Who's there?

FRANCISCO

    Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.

BERNARDO

    Long live the king!

FRANCISCO

    Bernardo?

BERNARDO

    He.

FRANCISCO

    You come most carefully upon your hour.

BERNARDO

    'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.

FRANCISCO

    For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
    And I am sick at heart.

BERNARDO

    Have you had quiet guard?

FRANCISCO

    Not a mouse stirring.

BERNARDO

    Well, good night.
    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
    The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.

FRANCISCO

    I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?

    Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS

HORATIO

    Friends to this ground.

MARCELLUS

    And liegemen to the Dane.

FRANCISCO

    Give you good night.
